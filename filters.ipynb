        "### Filtering\n",
        "There are 4 types of filters: **lowpass**, **highpass**, **bandpass**, and **bandstop**. They refer to the frequency response of the filter, e.g., lowpass means to allow low frequencies through (from 0Hz to the cutoff) and filter out high frequencies, the opposite for highpass. Bandpass allows through a narrow band frequency and filters out the rest, while bandstop does the opposite, which is commonly used for filtering out a specific frequency of noise (such as 50 Hz line noise in Poland). Filter design is an art that will take many such labs to cover extensively, so we will just introduce the idea here and give you the tools to explore that at a later stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Finite Impulse Response\n",
        "The filter response can be examined in both time and frequency domain. If we plot the coefficients of an FIR filter in time, that's quite literally its impulse response function (IRF), i.e., if you tried to filter a delta with this function, it will output itself. FIR stands for finite impulse response, which means the impulse response function has finite time. Infinite impulse response (IIR) filters, on the other hand, have feedback, and thus will continue out to infinity even for a single delta input. Here, we will only use FIR filters.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `signal.firwin()`\n",
        "A quick tutorial on `signal.firwin()`: this function designs the FIR filter based on your frequency requirements, and return the filter coefficients. The 4 critical parameters are `numtaps`, `fs`, `cutoff`, and `pass_zero`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `numtaps` is the filter \"order\", basically, how many points are in the filter. The longer the filter is, the better frequency resolution you will have, but worse temporal resolution.\n",
        "- `fs` is the sampling rate of your signal\n",
        "- `cutoff` defines the frequency to pass/block\n",
        "- `pass_zero` defines whether 0Hz is passed or blocked; it can also be a string argument for the desired filter type: `'bandpass', 'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandstop'`\n",
        "\n",
        "`cutoff` and `pass_zero`, in conjunction, defines the filter type. If your cutoff is at 20Hz and define `pass_zero=True`, then `firwin()` interprets that to be a lowpass filter. If `pass_zero=False`, then it's a highpass filter. Same idea applies to bandpass and bandstop, except `cutoff` is now required to be a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `np.convolve()`\n",
        "Finally, to apply the filter, we simply convolve the signal with the filter, using `np.convolve()`. Remember, convolution in time domain is multiplication in frequency domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, there is a demonstration of an example lowpass filter, with its IRF plotted in time and frequency."
